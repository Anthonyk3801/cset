You could create a guessing game and have the user guess the correct number but they only have three chances. If the user guesses the wrong number three times then something happens to them. Then you would put a paragraph to show that the game ended but if they guess correctly then they can move on to the next part of the game. If the game ended you could make a reset button for the user to go back to the beginning to play again. If they move on to the next part of the game you could create another event for the user to get past and if they pass it you can put another paragraph to show that they won the game. You could also change the style of the text for the victory and defeat paragraphs to make them look better.
