I'm looking forward to working on more than one page so I can change how it looks a little from the other pages. I also am excited to see what I can do with more than one page for a website. I think it will get me to think about how to structure the pages and make me work harder to create something better than what I do on one page of a website. It will make me become a little bit better at creating multiple pages on a website and get me prepared for when I have to do web pages for people or companies.

 <div>A  
  <div>B
    <div>C</div>
  </div>
 </div>
For the bubbling event if I put a click event listener on each element it will first go off the innermost element and then it will fire on element B then element A. You could also stop the bubbling event by putting a stop propagation to stop the clicking from going to B and A. For the propagation event it will be the opposite and go from the outermost element and fire off of the events in the order of A B C. Both the bubbling and propagation do the same thing but in a different way.

The event object is mouseMove that has many useful properties. The properties for mouseMove are offsetX and offsetY. They help you know where the mouse pointer is on the page. For example in a game the properties will allow you to know the exact location of the mouse pointer on the X axis and the Y axis of the page. Another useful event object is event.target. It targets a specific div and lets it change the css properties of the div. You can also use event.target to change the data attribute in the html.
