I feel like the program is a little bit fast for me. I am learning a lot of new information which I haven't seen before. There is also a lot of reading involved. I am not the best reader so it takes me longer to read and comprehend. Sometimes when I'm not done with a practice problem and then other practice problems are assigned, I feel slightly overwhelmed. I also feel anxious when there is a lot of things due on the same day and then we go to learn a new chapter. 

Functions are a useful tool because they make the code easier to follow, read and understand. It also makes it easier to correct or change the code. When you are coding and your program is getting large you will need functions so you can write other code to call the function you want to work on.

Global scopes are a program that refers to bindings when they are outside of the function. If bindings are not used in a function then those bindings can be seen in or all over the global scope. Global scope example `let x = 2; if(true){ let y = 9; console.log(2 + 9); } console.log(x);`. The number two can be seen because it is referred to before the function is created. Local scopes can only be seen in the function because that's the only place that it's referred to. Every function has it's local scope so that when you put in a code in that function it can only be called or referred to in that function. Local scope example `let y = 9; if(true) { let x = 12; console.log(9 * 12); } console.log(y);`. X is referred to in the function so it can't be seen if you tried to make another call out of that function.
